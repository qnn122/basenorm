T1	Title 0 132	Bile resistance in Lactococcus lactis strains varies with cellular fatty acid composition: analysis by using different growth media.
T2	Paragraph 133 2382	Bile resistance is one of the basic characteristics of probiotic bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of bile resistance in lactococci by studying the relationship between bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in lactococcci grown on different media. We determined the bile resistance of 14 strains in lactose-free M17 medium supplemented with either glucose only (GM17) or lactose only (LM17). Gas chromatographic analyses of free lipids extracted from the tested strains were used for determining their fatty acid composition. A correlation analysis of all strains grown in both media revealed significant positive correlations between bile resistance and relative contents of hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid, and negative correlations between bile resistance and relative contents of hexadecenoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid. It is also a fact that the fatty acids associated with bile resistance depended on species, strain, and/or growth medium. In L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains grown in GM17 medium, the bile-resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid than the bile-sensitive strains. In LM17 medium, bile-resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid and significantly less C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid than the bile-sensitive strains. In L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, bile resistances of some of the tested strains were altered by growth medium. Some strains were resistant to bile in GM17 medium but sensitive to bile in LM17 medium. Some strains were resistant in both media tested. The strains grown in GM17 medium had significantly more hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid, and significantly less tetradecanoic acid, octadecadienoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid than the strains grown in LM17 medium. In conclusion, the fatty acid compositions of the bile-resistant lactococci differed from those of the bile-sensitive ones. More importantly, our data suggest that altering their fatty acid composition (i.e. increased hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid and decreased hexadecenoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid) by changing growth conditions may be a useful way to enhance their bile resistance in lactococci.
