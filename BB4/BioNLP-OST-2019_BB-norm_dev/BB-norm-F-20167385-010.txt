With regard to the Corynebacterium species, C. casei and C. variabilis were those more commonly isolated from the cheese rinds ( Brennan et al., 2002, Mounier et al., 2005 and Rea et al., 2007). C. flavescens was only found on the rind of Gorgonzola and Scimudin cheeses. This species was also isolated by  Brennan et al. (2002) on the surface of Gobbeen cheese, though only once during the ripening. C. flavescens produced a yellow pigment and together with C. casei, C. variabile, and C. ammoniagenes are considered dairy species ( Denis and Irlinger, 2008).
