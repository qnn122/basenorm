In semi-hard cheeses, like Gouda or Cheddar, degradation of protein 
into amino acids and subsequent conversion of amino acids by Lactococcus sp. and/or Lactobacillus sp. is crucial for flavour development (Smit et al. 2000; Visser 1993). Other examples of microorganisms involved in the formation of very diverse flavours in dairy products are Propionibacterium sp. in Maasdammer and Swiss-type cheeses (Sarkar and Misra 1995), Streptococcus sp., Lb. bulgaricus spp. and Bifidobacterium sp. in (health-promoting) yoghurts (Nosova et al. 2000; Zourari et al. 1992; Hugenholtz et al. 2000), and Arthrobacter, Brevibacterium and Corynebacterium sp. in surface-ripened cheeses (Bockelmann and Hoppe Seyler 2001).
