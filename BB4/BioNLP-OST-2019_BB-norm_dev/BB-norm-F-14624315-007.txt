This could also be seen from the data: in L. lactis subsp. cremoris B1157 about 80% of the flavour formed in the incubation experiment was 3-methylbutanal, while for C. ammoniagenes B1506 this percentage was about 20% (data not shown).Taken
 together, our results indicate that various strains and species used in
 the dairy industry vary significantly in the enzyme activities involved
 in the conversion of the amino acid leucine into flavour components 
like 3-methylbutanal.
