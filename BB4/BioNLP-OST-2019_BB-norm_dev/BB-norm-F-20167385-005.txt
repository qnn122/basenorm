When V3 region of 16S rRNA gene 
motility from the isolates was compared with those of the reference 
strains on DGGE gels, several Staphylococcus were identified, mainly S. saprophyticus, S. equorum, S. vitulinus and S. caprae species. E. faecalis, E. faecium, B. linens, Corynebacterium flavescens were also frequently isolated. M. luteus
