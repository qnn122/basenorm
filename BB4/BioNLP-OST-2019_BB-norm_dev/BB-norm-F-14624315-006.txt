Nevertheless, only two strains were found to be able to produce
 3-methylbutanal or the reduced aldehyde, 3-methylbutanol. This 
3-methylbutanal production clearly correlated with the presence or 
absence of decarboxylase activity. Again the difference between L. lactis B1157 and B697 is illustrative (Fig. 3),
 with B1157 being decarboxylase-positive and B697 negative.
