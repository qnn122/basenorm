DGGE bands (a, b, e, g, h, i) corresponding to Psychrobacter species were evident in Formaggio di Fossa, Gorgonzola, Taleggio and Scimudin. DGGE band “d” identified as Staphylococcus equorum was present in all cheese profiles, with the most intense signal in Casera. Micrococcus luteus (band “l”) was detected in all samples except for Casera cheese, while the band for S. vitulinus (band “c”) was only evident in Scimudin. A faint DNA band of Lactobacillus delbrueckii (band “f”) could be detected in Casera and Gorgonzola cheeses, as well as faint Streptococcus thermophilus band (“k”) in the Casera and Formaggio di Fossa samples. Enterococcus faecium
 band (band “j”) was detected in Casera cheese, and showed less 
intensity in Formaggio di Fossa and Scimudin cheeses. DGGE bands of Brevibacterium casei (bands “n”) and B. linens (band “m”) could only be observed in Casera cheese surface.
