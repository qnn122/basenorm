However, to date, a cheese-associated mgl gene has only been identified in Brevibacterium linens ( Amarita et al., 2004, Monnet et al., 2010 and Schröder et al., 2011). Our metagenomic sequencing uncovered previously undescribed mgl sequences with high sequence similarity to various γ-Proteobacteria in cheeses from both Europe and North America ( Table S4B). Several of these previously undescribed mgl sequences belonged to Pseudoalteromonas spp. ( Figures 4C and S4B). We mapped metagenomic reads from three cheeses in which Pseudoalteromonas was abundant to the reference genome of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (99.5% pairwise identity,  Table S4C). Additionally, Pseudoalteromonas is known to have many cold-adapted enzymes that function in the polar seawater where this bacterium typically grows ( Médigue et al., 2005).
