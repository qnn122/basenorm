In most anaerobic strains belonging to the genera Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Leuconostoc, specific hydroxy acid dehydrogenase activity was found to be 5- to 10-fold higher than the transaminase activity.The decarboxylation of Î±-ketoisocaproic acid leads to the formation of 3-methylbutanal (Fig. 1). This decarboxylase activity was found in only two of the strains tested (B1157 and B1506) (Fig. 3C).
