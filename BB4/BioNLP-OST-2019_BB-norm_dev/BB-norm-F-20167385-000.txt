Bands showing different intensity and identified as Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Psychrobacter, Enterococcus and Brevibacterium
 species were detected on the surface of cheeses. The cluster analysis 
showed that Gorgonzola, Taleggio and Formaggio di Fossa cheeses present 
high similarity in their surface bacterial composition while major 
differences in the DGGE profiles were observed in Scimudin and Casera. 
The molecular taxonomical identification among the Gram positive 
isolates, reveals the presence of the following bacterial genera: Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Macrococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Carnobacterium, Leuconostoc, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Brochothrix, Bacillus.
