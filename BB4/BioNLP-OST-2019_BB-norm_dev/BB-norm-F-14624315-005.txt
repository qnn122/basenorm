In line with this, L. lactis subsp. cremoris B697, a strain with a high hydroxy acid dehydrogenase activity compared to the transaminase activity (Fig. 3A, B), did not produce detectable amounts of 3-methylbutanal. Interestingly, L. lactis subsp. cremoris strain B1157, a strain reported to produce high levels of 3-methylbutanal (Ayad et al. 1999, 2000),
 has transaminase and hydroxy acid dehydrogenase activities 
approximately similar to those of strain B697.
