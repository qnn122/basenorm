Bacterial enumeration revealed 
the presence of a large community of Staphylococcus and micrococci-corynebacteria groups on the cheese surfaces. Although E. faecium DNA was present in Formaggio di Fossa, no presumptive enterococci were found on Enterococcus
 selective agar (SB), though they were detected in different amounts in 
Casera, Taleggio, Gorgonzola and Scimudin cheeses. Lactobacilli were 
also detected using Rogosa agar in all cheese surfaces in a range of 104â€“106 CFU/cm2. The counts obtained on Pseudomonas agar were high in Gorgonzola, Scimudin and Taleggio surfaces (108 CFU/cm2), while in Casera samples the Pseudomonas values were three log units lower, and were absent (< 100) in Formaggio di Fossa.Table 3.
