For
 most uninoculated microbial groups, their function in the context of 
the community or in the production of cheese is largely unexplored. For 
example, we identified two bacterial genera, Yaniella and Nocardiopsis, that have never been reported in food microbial ecosystems. We also find that halotolerant γ-Proteobacteria such as Vibrio, Halomonas, and Pseudoalteromonas that are typically associated with marine environments ( Holmström and Kjelleberg, 1999 and Reen et al., 2006) are widespread in cheese communities (Figure 2).
