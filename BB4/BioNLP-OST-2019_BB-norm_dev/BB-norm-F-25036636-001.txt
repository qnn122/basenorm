The fungus Galactomyces and four genera of Proteobacteria, both found in high abundance on moist bloomy rinds ( Figure S2C), are positively correlated with moisture (Figure 3D), whereas several other fungal and bacterial taxa (Scopulariopsis, Aspergillus, Actinobacteria, and Staphylococcus), which are abundant on dry natural rinds ( Figure S2C), are negatively associated with moisture (Figure 3D).
