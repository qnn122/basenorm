In addition, the 
production of growth factors by yeasts appears to promote the 
development of a Gram positive, catalase positive, salt-tolerant 
microbial communities composed mainly of coagulase-negative cocci (CNC) 
and coryneform bacteria, belonging to genera such as Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Brevibacterium, and Arthrobacter ( Bockelmann, 1999, Bockelmann et al., 1997, Corsetti et al., 2001, Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995a, Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995b and Vald√©s-Stauber et al., 1997)
