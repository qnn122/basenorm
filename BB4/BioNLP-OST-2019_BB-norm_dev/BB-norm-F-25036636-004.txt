From our metagenomic reads, we identified 
homologs of a previously characterized secreted cold-adapted lipase and 
protease ( de Pascale et al., 2008 and de Pascale et al., 2010) (Table S4C),
 which could contribute to lipolysis and proteolysis and subsequent 
flavor formation in cheeses. Collectively, these metagenomic insights 
into the potential function of Pseudoalteromonas suggest that this and other uninoculated yet abundant microbes could play key roles in cheese rind microbial communities.
