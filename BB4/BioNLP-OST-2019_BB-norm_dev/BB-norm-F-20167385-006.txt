S. saprophyticus strains analysed ( Fig. 2A),
 at a similarity level of 60%; (i) Cluster 1 (S of 65%) containing two 
strains from Taleggio and Scimudin cheeses, (ii) Cluster 2 (S of 78%) 
only contained strains from Gorgonzola cheese, (iii) Cluster 3 (S of 
65%) included ten strains, of which 4 were isolated from Taleggio and 
Casera cheeses, and one each from Scimudin and Gorgonzola, and (iv) 
Cluster 4 (S of 80%) including three strains, of which one was from 
Taleggio and two from Scimudin cheeses. The cluster analysis of 23S. equorum strains ( Fig. 2B)
 shows two main clusters (i) Cluster 1 (S of 84%) containing strains 
from Taleggio (4), Scimudin (6), Casera (5) and Gorgonzola (1) cheeses 
and (ii) Cluster 2 (S of 87%) including 4 strains from Gorgonzola, 2 
from Scimudin and only one from Taleggio.
