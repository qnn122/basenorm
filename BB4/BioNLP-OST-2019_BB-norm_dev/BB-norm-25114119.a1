T1	Title 0 199	Characterization of a lipopolysaccharide-targeted monoclonal antibody and its variable fragments as candidates for prophylaxis against the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Coxiella burnetii.
T2	Paragraph 200 1966	Our previous study demonstrated that treatment of Coxiella burnetii with the phase I lipopolysaccharide (PI-LPS)-targeted monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1E4 significantly inhibited C. burnetii infection in mice, suggesting that 1E4 is a protective MAb. To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies (Abs) can provide protection against C. burnetii natural infection, we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect SCID mice against C. burnetii aerosol infection. The results indicated that 1E4 conferred significant protection against aerosolized C. burnetii, suggesting that 1E4 may be useful for preventing C. burnetii natural infection. To further understand the mechanisms of 1E4-mediated protection and to test the possibility of using humanized 1E4 to prevent C. burnetii infection, we examined whether the Fab fragment of 1E4 (Fab1E4), a recombinant murine single-chain variable fragment (muscFv1E4), and a humanized single-chain variable fragment (huscFv1E4) retained the ability of 1E4 to inhibit C. burnetii infection. The results indicated that Fab1E4, muscFv1E4, and huscFv1E4 were able to inhibit C. burnetii infection in mice but that their ability to inhibit C. burnetii infection was lower than that of 1E4. In addition, treatment of C. burnetii with Fab1E4, muscFv1E4, or huscFv1E4 can block C. burnetii infection of macrophages. Interestingly, treatment of C. burnetii with huscFv1E4 can significantly reduce C. burnetii infectivity in human macrophages. This report provides the first evidence to demonstrate that the humanized variable fragments of an LPS-specific MAb can neutralize C. burnetii infection and appears to be a promising step toward the potential use of a humanized MAb as emergency prophylaxis against C. burnetii exposure.
