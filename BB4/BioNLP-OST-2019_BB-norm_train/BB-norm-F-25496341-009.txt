As all the DNA present in the cheese 
samples is sequenced, the high throughput sequencing may detect any type
 of DNA (bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses), provided that 
adequate references are used. Eukaryotes, such as Geotrichum candidum, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Penicillium roqueforti,
 were found, which was not surprising, as these fungi are frequently 
used in cheesemaking.
