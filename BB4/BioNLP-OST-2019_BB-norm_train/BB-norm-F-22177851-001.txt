Results showed that P. celer was able to successfully implant 
itself in cheese, regardless of its inoculation level. However, when it 
was inoculated at a high level, the bacterial biodiversity was 
drastically lowered from day 25 to the end of ripening. Overall, the 
presence of P. celer led to the higher production of volatile 
aroma compounds such as aldehydes, ketones and sulfur compounds. 
Regardless of its inoculation level, H. alvei barely affected 
the growth of the bacterial community and was subdominant at the end of 
ripening. It influenced total volatile aroma compound production with 
volatile sulfur compounds being the most abundant.
