Our
 study provides data, which combined with publicly available genome 
references, represents the most expansive catalog to date of 
cheese-associated bacteria. Using this extended dairy catalog, we 
revealed the presence in traditional cheese of dominant microorganisms 
not deliberately inoculated, mainly Gram-negative genera such as Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis or Psychrobacter immobilis, that may contribute to the characteristics of cheese produced through traditional methods.
