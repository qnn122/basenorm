The strain S3 + and its protease-negative variant S3-, assigned to Lactococcus lactis sp. lactis, was used for cheese-making. The 11 microorganisms that composed the model community included seven bacteria — Lactobacillus casei FH1, Arthrobacter arilaitensis Re117, Corynebacterium casei Mu120, C. flavescens Mu128, C. variabile Mu129, Staphylococcus xylosus Com1 and S. equorum Mu2 — and four yeasts — D. hansenii DH68, G. candidum GC129, Y. lipolytica CI35 and K. lactis
 KL65. This composition is representative of the diversity of smear soft
 cheese. The microorganisms were originally isolated from Munster except
 for Re117 (Reblochon), Com1 (unknown) and FH1 (St. Nectaire). The 
Gram-negative bacteria studied, P. celer 91 and H. alvei
 2 920, isolated from Livarot and Munster cheese, respectively, were 
chosen from a large cheese bacteria collection for their low level of 
sanitary risk (sensitivity to 24 antibiotics, no production of biogenic 
amines in synthetic media and no growth under anaerobic condition and at
 37 °C) (Coton et al., 2012).
