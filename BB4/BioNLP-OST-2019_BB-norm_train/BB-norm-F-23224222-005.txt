Culture
 dependent isolation followed by genotypic identifications was basically
 confirmed by the culture-independent method, DGGE (Fig. 4). Additionally, in the sample from the interior of the cheese from dairy A, DGGE band with strong intensity was identified as Streptococcus thermophilus. Furthermore, DGGE bands with strong intensities from the cheese surface samples were found to represent Vagococcus carniphilus (the cheeses from dairies A, B and D), Psychrobacter spp. (the cheeses from dairies A and C) and Lb. curvatus
 (the cheese from dairy B) indicating that these bacterial species may 
play a role in cheese ripening, even though they were not found by the 
culture dependent approach. Unfortunately, several major DGGE bands in 
the samples from the cheese surface could not be successfully 
identified.
