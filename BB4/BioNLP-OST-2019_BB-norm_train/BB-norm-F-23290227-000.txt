The Hafnia strains slightly reduced counts of Enterococcus faecalis (~âˆ’ 0.5 log from day 1) and promoted Lactobacillus plantarum
 growth (+ 0.2 to 0.5 log from day 8) in cheese. They produced 
small amounts of putrescine (~ 1.3 mmol/kg) and cadaverine 
(~ 0.9 mmol/kg) in cheese after 28 days, and did not 
affect levels of volatile aroma compounds. Further work on H. alvei strain B16 showed that E. coli O26:H11, inoculated at 2 log CFU/ml, was inhibited by H. alvei
 B16 inoculated at 6 log CFU/ml and not at 
4.5 log CFU/ml.
