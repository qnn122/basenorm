In our cheese model, 
methanethiol, DMDS, DMTS and DMS should significantly contribute to 
flavor because of their very low perception thresholds and their garlic 
or very ripe cheese notes ( Sabl√© and Cottenceau, 1999). The high capacity of H. alvei
 to produce VSC is probably the result of its high capacity to convert 
methionine or cysteine into aroma compounds with a transamination or 
deamination activity. It was previously shown that VSC (methanethiol, 
DMDS, DMTS) were produced by H. alvei but grown on beef models ( Dainty et al., 1989).
