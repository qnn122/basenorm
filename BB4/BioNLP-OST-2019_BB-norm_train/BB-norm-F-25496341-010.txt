High throughput sequencing allows higher resolution 
quantitation and we have shown that we can recover even fairly minor 
taxonomi groups, such as the Leuconostoc genus (see Additional file 14: Table S8), known to be part of the minority population in cheeses [48]. However, additional experiments may be needed to validate the identification and quantitation of low abundance populations.Presence
 or absence of complete set of genes or of specific genes, and their 
level of sequence homology allows also confirming characteristics of 
particular strains.
