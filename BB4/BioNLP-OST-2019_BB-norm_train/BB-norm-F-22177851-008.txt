At day 5, in the two 
cheese ecosystems, C. flavescens dominated the cheese surface 
with 6.4 log10 cfu/g. However, from day 15 to day 35, distribution of 
bacterial species between the cheese without H. alvei (T) and the cheese with H. alvei (HA2) was different. In the absence of H. alvei, A. arilaitensis dominated the cheese surface with counts of 9.3 log10 cfu/g at day 35. With H. alvei in the cheese ecosystem, the maximal population of A. arilaitensis was 7.4 log10 cfu/g at day 35.
