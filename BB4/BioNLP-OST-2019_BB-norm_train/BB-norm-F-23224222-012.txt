Finally, the filamentous fungus Scopulariopsis brevicaulis was found in a high number on cheese A. S. brevicaulis has previously been found in Danish cheese [52],
 and has been subject to spoilage of cheeses due to its high proteolytic
 activity resulting in ammonia production and its production of 
arsenical compounds, e.g., diethylarsine, which has a very 
characteristic garlic-like odour [5].
