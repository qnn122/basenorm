Contents
========

  ** `.txt' files: each file contains the text contents of a document. Each document is a PubMed abstract (including the title) or a passage in a full-text document. The `.txt' files are encoded in UTF-8. The name of the files follow either pattern:

        BB-norm-PMID.txt
	BB-norm-F-PMID-NNN.txt

     the first pattern indicates a PubMed entry (title and abstract),
     the second pattern indicates a passage in an article full-text,
     PMID is the PubMed identifier of the document,
     NNN is the number of the passage in the document.

  ** `.a1' files: for each `.txt' file, the corresponding `.a1' file contains input annotations:
     title and abstract paragraph boundaries
     named-entity boundaries (number of unicode characters, starting at 0, from the first entity character to the character after the entity)
