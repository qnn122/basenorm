In a first
 example, we compared the genomic sequences of the four Arthrobacter strains isolated from cheese to that of 15 environmental isolates. Most bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter are isolated from environments such as soil, where they are considered to be ubiquitous [41].
 Interestingly, the four cheese strains share several properties that 
may be linked to adaptation to the cheese habitat, such as a cluster of 
five genes involved in the catabolism of D-galactonate, as already 
described in Arthrobacter arilaitensis Re117 [20].
