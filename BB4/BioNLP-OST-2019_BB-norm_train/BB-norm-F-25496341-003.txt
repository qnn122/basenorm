As a second example, we compared the genomes of two strains of Streptococcus infantarius
 isolated from Western African fermented milks, sequenced in this work 
(3AG and 11FA), with those of the type strain isolated from infant feces
 (ATCC BAA-102), and of strain CJ18, isolated from Eastern African 
fermented milk. The four strains contain each 1900â€“2000 genes and share 
1567 genes.
