They sometimes constitute more than 40% of the bacterial microbiota of some smear cheese surfaces ( Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2005, Mounier et al., 2009 and Larpin-Laborde et al., 2011). The most common genera are Psychrobacter that includes psychrotrophic species, Halomonas, frequently isolated from marine environments, and Hafnia, of which some strains are commercialized and inoculated during cheese-making ( Mounier et al., 2005, Mounier et al., 2009 and Rea et al., 2007).
