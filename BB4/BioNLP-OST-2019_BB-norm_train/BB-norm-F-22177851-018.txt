These branch-chain aldehydes and alcohols are 
associated with fruity tastes and are considered to be potent odorants 
in Camembert ( Curioni and Bosset, 2002). The production of 3-methylbutanal and 3-methylbutanol has already been reported in P. phenylpyruvica in a cured meat model system ( Moller et al., 1998), and in Psychrobacter sp. in a model cheese ( Deetae et al., 2009a). When P. celer
 was present in cheeses, 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone were 
produced in greater quantities than in the control cheeses.
