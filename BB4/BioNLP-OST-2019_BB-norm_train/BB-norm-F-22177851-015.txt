D. hansenii, G. candidum, Y. lipolytica and A. arilaitensis
 were dominant on the cheese surface at day 35 of ripening. These yeasts
 were also the dominant species in Munster and Livarot cheeses ( Larpin et al., 2006), and it was previously shown that two French red-smear soft cheeses were largely dominated by A. arilaitensis ( Feurer et al., 2004).
