The production of exopolysaccharides by LAB has been correlated to specific gene clusters tagged as eps or cps, located, as in Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus plantarum, mainly on the bacterial chromosome (Stingele et al. 1996; De Vuyst and Degeest 1999; Siezen et al. 2010) or in species such as Lactococcus lactis and Pediococcus damnsosus predominantly on plasmids (Van Kranenburg et al. 1997, 1999b). Remus et al. (2012) identified four cps genes clusters in the chromosome of L. plantarum WCFS1, which are associated with surface polysaccharide production.
