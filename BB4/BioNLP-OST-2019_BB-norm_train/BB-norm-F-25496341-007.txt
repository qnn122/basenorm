These data suggest that 
the Halomonas strains present in the cheese sample are almost 
identical to the reference strain. However, even though the reference 
strain 1 M45 has also been isolated from a smear-ripened cheese of 
the same protected designation of origin, it originated from another 
manufacturing plant. More than fifty thousand reads were assigned to Providencia heimbachae
 GR4.
