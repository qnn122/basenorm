The present study confirms that Debaryomyces hansenii and Geotrichum spp. are the dominating yeast species on surface-ripened cheeses. D. hansenii was found to be the dominating yeast species on the cheeses from dairies C and D, whereas Geotrichum spp. was found to dominate on the cheese from dairy B. On the cheese from dairy A, Yarrowia lipolytica was the dominating yeast species. Y. lipolytica
 is a naturally developing yeast species on cheese surfaces, and has in 
some cases been shown to rapidly outnumber other yeast species including
 D. hansenii and Geotrichum spp. [33].
