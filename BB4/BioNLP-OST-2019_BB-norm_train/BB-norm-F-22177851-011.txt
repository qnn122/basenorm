The community containing H. alvei
 (inoculated at a low or high level) produced the largest quantity of 
aroma compounds – between 13 and 15 mg/kg of total aroma compounds –
 primarily corresponding to sulfur compounds [methanethiol, dimethyl 
disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS)]. The overall production
 of aroma compounds was enhanced when P. celer was inoculated at a high level: 8.1 mg/kg versus 4.5 mg/kg in the community without P. celer.
 Mainly aldehydes (3-methylbutanal), ketones (2-heptanone, 2-nonanone, 
2-pentanone) and sulfur compounds (DMDS) were produced ( Table 2).
