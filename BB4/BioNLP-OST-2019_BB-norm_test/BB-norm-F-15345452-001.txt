Nondesirable microorganisms, such as the psychrotrophic Pseudomonas fluorescens (52) or certain proteolytic LAB, may cause flavor defects (e.g., bitterness and putrid flavors) in milks and cheeses (7, 8, 51). The presence of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in raw milks and cheeses constitutes a health risk (3, 10, 12, 33, 41, 49).
