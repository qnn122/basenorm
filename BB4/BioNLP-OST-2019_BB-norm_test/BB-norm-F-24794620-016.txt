We found the filamentous fungus Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (OTU 1) and the yeasts Pyxidiophora arvernensis (OTU 2), Debaryomyces hansenii (OTU 3) and Nectria mariannaeae
 (OTU 4) to be the most abundant fungi in the cheese rind samples 
analyzed. This finding is consistent with recent results on the surfaces
 of Danish cheeses, where Debaryomyces hansenii and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis were found to be abundant ( Gori et al., 2013). The occurrence of S. brevicaulis in raw milk and cheese has been confirmed by other recent studies ( Lavoie et al., 2012 and Ropars et al., 2012) and Debaryomyces hansenii has been found on Fontina and various Austrian cheeses ( Dolci et al., 2009, Dolci et al., 2013, Lopandic et al., 2006 and Prillinger et al., 1999). We also observed Pyxidiophora- and Nectria-like OTUs that have not been previously described in cheese, although Nectria has been isolated from raw cow's milk ( Lavoie et al., 2012).
