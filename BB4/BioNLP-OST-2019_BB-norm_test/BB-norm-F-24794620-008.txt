Similarly to previous studies (Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2009 and Quigley et al., 2013), we found Halomonas (OTU1) to be the most frequent OTU in short-ripened cheeses from all facilities (A, B, C). For some time the occurrence of Halomonas in dairy products was a matter for controversial discussion. Halomonas was suggested to be an indicator for hygienic deficiencies in cheese producing facilities ( Maoz et al., 2003),
 while it has also been suggested that these bacteria, which originally 
originate in marine environments, are added via sea salt to cheese 
surfaces during washing and dry salting (Ishikawa et al., 2007). The dominance of Halomonas
 in short-ripened cheese rinds is most likely due to more frequent 
washing with a higher brine concentration. The high abundance of Halomonas
 in VB cheese rinds suggests an important function during cheese 
ripening, particularly of young cheese. However, it is still unknown 
whether Halomonas contributes to the flavor or texture of VB or other cheeses.Coryneform bacteria including Brevibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Microbacterium spp. and Brachybacterium
 spp. are important for cheese ripening due to their proteolytic 
activity and because they produce volatile sulfur compounds or ammonia (
 Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995). Similarly to other studies ( Dolci et al., 2009, Feurer et al., 2004b, Gori et al., 2013, Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2005 and Rea et al., 2007), we found a high diversity and abundance of coryneforms (13 OTUs, 149 out of 408 clones) in VB cheese rinds.B. linens
 is an important flavor producer and responsible for the development of 
the typical red pigmentation of red-smear cheeses, which result from the
 production of a red carotenoid. It has been described as the most 
common organism on cheese surfaces ( Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995 and Rattray and Fox, 1999).
