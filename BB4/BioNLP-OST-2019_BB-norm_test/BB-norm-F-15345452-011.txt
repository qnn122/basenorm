For example, we identified Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus plantarum as major components of the red smear cheeses (Langres and Epoisses cheese cores) or Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis
 in Swiss-type cheeses (Comt√© and Beaufort cheese cores).
