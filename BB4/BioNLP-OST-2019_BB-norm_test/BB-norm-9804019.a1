T1	Title 0 54	Aurioscope earpieces--a potential vector of infection?
T2	Paragraph 55 360	to determine whether non disposable aurioscope earpieces used in community paediatric clinics harbored pathogenic micro-organisms, and to explore primary pediatrician perception of the possibility of cross infection from contaminated aurioscope earpieces and of how their aurioscope earpieced are cleaned.
T3	Paragraph 361 379	randomized survey.
T4	Paragraph 380 413	four community pediatric clinics.
T5	Paragraph 414 1049	42 pediatricians' aurioscope earpieces were cultured on blood agar and mannitol-salt-agar plates by two methods: (1) The earpieces were rolled for 5 s onto blood agar plates (TSA + 5% sheep blood, and a mannitol-salt-agar-plate). (2) The entire surface of the earpiece was swabbed with a sterile cotton tipped applicator moistened in sterile saline solution and was inoculated immediately onto a blood agar plate, and a mannitol-salt-agar-plate. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h and examined for colony growth at 24 and 48 h of incubation. Culture results were recorded as mean numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs).
T6	Paragraph 1050 1353	36 from 42 (86%) of the aurioscope earpieces were colonized by micro-organisms. Heavily contaminated earpieces were found in six (14%). Staphylococci were isolated from 27 (64%) of the earpieces: 19 (45%) being Staphylococci aureus coagulase positive, 4 (9%) were methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
T7	Paragraph 1354 1751	Non disposable earpieces can harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria including MRSA. The increased trend for children with immunodeficiency to be managed in an ambulatory setting, often by physicians who also work in hospital, might be a risk of spreading potentially serious infections to such patients. Non disposable earpieces should be regularly disinfected to minimize the spread of infection.
