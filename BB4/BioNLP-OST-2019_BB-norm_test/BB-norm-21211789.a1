T1	Title 0 122	Identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
T2	Paragraph 123 376	In this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease.
T3	Paragraph 377 1124	Nineteen patients with CP without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with CP and CKD who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with CP and CKD who were on renal replacement therapy (RRT group) were examined. The severity of CP was based on the investigation of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The definition and stage of CKD were based on the criteria proposed by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the equation of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
T4	Paragraph 1125 1543	Candida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on RRT and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. CP was more severe in patients with CKD. A strong association was observed between the frequency of C. albicans (P = 0.056), P.gingivalis (P = 0.008), T. denticola (P = 0.013) and CAL, when CKD patients were compared with the control group.
T5	Paragraph 1544 1688	CP is more severe and is associated with increased frequency of C. albicans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in patients with CKD.
