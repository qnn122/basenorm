TTGE profiles of core Beaufort cheeses (data not shown) are nearly 
identical to those of core Comt√© cheeses. No differences were seen in 
TTGE patterns between samples originating from the same part of the 
cheese. However, TTGE patterns revealed differences in bacterial 
composition between the cheese core and cheese surface. The cheese core 
was generally inhabited by various LAB (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Streptococcus thermophilus), whereas the cheese surface was generally inhabited by staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria (Moraxella bovis and Pseudomonas sp.).
