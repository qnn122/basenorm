Psychrobacter spp. are frequently found in samples of milk and cheese samples ( Deetae et al., 2009, Gori et al., 2013, Irlinger et al., 2012 and Mounier et al., 2009)
 and contribute significantly to cheese ripening, being responsible for 
the production of aroma compounds and the sensory quality of the cheese (
 Deetae et al., 2009 and Irlinger et al., 2012). We found a high abundance of P. aquaticus (OTU 9) in young cheese rinds of ripening cellar A1.
