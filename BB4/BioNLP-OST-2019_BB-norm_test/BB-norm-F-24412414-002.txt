Several studies have reported the ability of many LAB to produce PLA, including species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Pediococcus acidilactici, although its production has been found to be species- and strain- dependent ( Lavermicocca et al., 2000, Valerio et al., 2004, Li et al., 2007, Gerez et al., 2009, Gerez et al., 2010, Gerez et al., 2013, Valerio et al., 2009, Prema et al., 2010, Ryan et al., 2011 and Mu et al., 2012a). Additionally, PLA production has been reported for Geotrichum candidum ( Dieuleveux et al., 1998) and some propionibacteria (Lind et al., 2007).
