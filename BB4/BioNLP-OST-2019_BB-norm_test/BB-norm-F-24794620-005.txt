The most abundant 
OTUs had highest similarity to: Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (OTU 1, relative abundance: 39.4%), Pyxidiophora arvernensis (OTU 2, relative abundance: 25.8%) and Debaryomyces hansenii
 (OTU 3, relative abundance: 18.3%) (Supplementary Table S4). The 
phylogeny of all OTUs and their relative abundance in the ripening 
cellars are shown in  Fig. 2.
