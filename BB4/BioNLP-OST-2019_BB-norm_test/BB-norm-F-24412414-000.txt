In this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (including 5 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 Lactobacillus fermentum, 1 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 Lactobacillus plantarum, 1 Lactobacillus sakei, and 1 Lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, and Aspergillus flavus)
 and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 
3-phenyllactic acid (PLA). Results demonstrated that all molds were 
sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (CFS) from 
LAB fermentations (p < 0.05), with growth 
inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%.
