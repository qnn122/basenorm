Bacteria in the unknown ecosystems were assigned an identity by
 comparison with a comprehensive bacterial reference database of âˆ¼150 
species that included useful dairy microorganisms (lactic acid 
bacteria), spoilage bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae), and pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus).
 Our analyses provide a high resolution of bacteria comprising the 
ecosystems of different commercial cheeses and identify species that 
could not be discerned by conventional methods; at least two species, 
belonging to the Halomonas and Pseudoalteromonas 
genera, are identified for the first time in a dairy ecosystem.
