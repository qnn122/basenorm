Pediococcus damnosus
 LMG 28219 is a lactic acid bacterium dominating the maturation phase of
 Flemish acid beer productions. It proved to be capable of growing in 
beer, thereby resisting this environment, which is unfavorable for 
microbial growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying its metabolic 
capabilities and niche adaptations were unknown up to now. In the 
present study, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis 
were used to investigate this strainâ€™s mechanisms to reside in the beer 
niche, with special focus on not only stress and hop resistances but 
also folate biosynthesis and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production.
