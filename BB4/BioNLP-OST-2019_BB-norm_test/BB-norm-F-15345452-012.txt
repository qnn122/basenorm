This microbial diversity reflected the dominant 
bacterial species of the ecosystem (39).The molecular approach allowed us to identify some species that are of particular interest: Lactobacillus buchneri,
 present in Morbier cheese, is a heterofermentative lactobacillus 
responsible for off-flavor defects caused by biogenic amine production (24, 54, 55). Specific detection of this microorganism could be of interest to the dairy industry. We also note that Propionibacterium freudenreichii
 was rapidly identified in Leerdamer cheese by DGGE; this microorganism 
is particularly difficult to cultivate on artificial medium and requires
 an incubation time of at least 7 days. Unexpectedly, we identified Pseudoalteromonas species and Halomonas
 species by sequencing two unassigned bands found in the Epoisses cheese
 profiles. This is the first time that these two salt-tolerant bacterial
 species are found in dairy products; their identification was enabled 
by molecular methods.
