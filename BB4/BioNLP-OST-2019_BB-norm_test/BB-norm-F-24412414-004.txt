An example of PLA identification produced by L. casei 21/1 is provided in  Fig. 4. PLA concentration ranged from 0.021 to 0.275 mM, with L. casei 21/1 and L. rhamnosus
 13075 yielding the highest values (0.275 ± 0.065 and 
0.242 ± 0.054 mM, respectively). In addition, PLA 
production levels were significantly different between strains of the 
same species (p < 0.05), which is in agreement with previous studies ( Valerio et al., 2004 and Broberg et al., 2007).Table 2.
