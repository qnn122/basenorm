The
 examination of 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that cheese rinds from 
facility A harbored significantly increased ratios of OTU 2 (B. aurantiacum) and OTU 9 (Psychrobacter aquaticus), while the 18S rRNA showed OTU 3 (D. hansenii) significantly increased (1.5, 13.5, and 7.5 fold changes, respectively). In cheese rinds from facility B, OTU 1 (H. boliviensis) and OTU 7 (B. conglomeratum) were significantly increased compared to the other facilities (1.5 and 2.7 fold change), whereas the 18S rRNA OTU 1 (Scopulariopsis brevicaulis) decreased significantly by 2.8 fold and OTU 2 (Pyxidiophora arvernensis) increased significantly (3.3 fold change). 16S rRNA gene libraries showed OTU 5 (A. kashmirensis) and 18S rRNA gene libraries showed OTU 4 (Nectria mariannaeae) to have increased significantly in facility C (10.4 and 6.5 fold change) ( Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S5 and S6).
