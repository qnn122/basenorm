he presence of Staphylococcus equorum
 and several other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci on the 
surfaces of long-ripened cheeses has been reported previously ( Gori et al., 2013 and Irlinger et al., 1997). S. equorum
 may contribute to the aromatic characteristics and the orange pigments 
of cheeses as a result of the production of extracellular proteolytic 
and lipolytic enzymes. Staphylococci have been reported to produce 
antibacterial substances, e.g. S. equorum strain WS 2733 produces a peptide antibiotic (macrococcin P1) on the surface of Raclette cheese, which inhibits the growth of L. monocytogenes ( Carnio et al., 2000). We detected a significant increase of S. equorum (OTU 3) in long-ripened cheese rinds of all facilities as well as in younger cheeses of ripening cellar A1.
