OTU 1 (H. boliviensis)
 was highly abundant in young cheeses and was most frequently found in 
ripening cellar B1 (61.0%). Cheese rinds from cellars A1 and A2 were 
dominated by OTU 2 (B. linens, relative abundance: 35.0 and 34.5%). OTU 3 (S. equorum) and OTU 4 (Brevibacterium sp.) were most abundant in old cheeses.Short-ripened cheese rinds harbored a significantly increased (p < 0.05) ratio of OTU 1, OTU 2, OTU 5 and OTU 9 (H. boliviensis, B. aurantiacum, A. kashmirensis, P. aquaticus; 5.7, 2.1, 2.9 and 10.1 fold changes, respectively) and a significantly decreased ratio of OTU 3, OTU 4, OTU 7 and OTU 11 (S. equorum, Brevibacterium pityocampae, Brachybacterium conglomeratum, Y. halotolerans; 3.6, 5.8, 3.7 and 10.4 fold changes, respectively) compared to long-ripened cheeses ( Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S5).Five out of seven 18S rRNA OTUs (87% of all clones) were shared between young and old cheeses (Fig. 4). Short-ripened cheeses harbored a significantly increased ratio of OTU 2 and OTU 3 (Pyxidiophora arvernensis, Debaryomyces hansenii; 1.1 and 3.4 fold changes), while OTU 4 (Nectria mariannaeae) could only be detected in short-ripened cheeses. OTU 1 and OTU 5 (Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Arachnomyces glareosus) were significantly increased in long-ripened cheeses (2.8 and 8.8 fold change) ( Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S6).Short-ripened cheeses were dominated by Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria.
