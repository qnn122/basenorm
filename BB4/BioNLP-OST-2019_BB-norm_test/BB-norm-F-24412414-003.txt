De Muynck et al. (2004) studied the antifungal activity of filtered broth from 20 LAB strains by using the agar-diffusion method, reporting that L. acidophilus LMG 9433, L. amylovorus DSM 20532, L. brevis LMG 6906, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis LMG 9196, and L. plantarum LMG 6907 were the strains with the highest activity against A. flavus MUCL 19945, Endomyces fibuliger MUCL 11443, and Eurotium repens MUCL 15977.  Schillinger and Villareal (2010) screened 69 LAB to assess their capacity to inhibit the growth of P. nordicum (an ochratoxin producing Penicillium species) in malt extract agar. These authors reported that 37 strains, including L. rhamnosus LGG and L. plantarum 299v, were effective against P. nordicum
 and that both acetic and lactic acids among other LAB metabolism 
products contributed to the observed inhibition. Recently, the 
antifungal activity of L. plantarum IMAU10014 against B. cinerea, Glomerella cingulate, Phytophthora drechsleri, Penicillium citrinum, P. digitatum, and Fusarium oxysporum has been reported ( Wang et al., 2012).
