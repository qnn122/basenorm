We found a strongly negative correlation between OTU 2 (B. aurantiacum) and OTU 15 (Leucobacter), suggesting that Leucobacter replace B. aurantiacum
 in the rinds of old VB cheeses, particularly in cellars B2 and C1. In 
addition, weaker (r > 0.6) negative correlations of OTU 2 with 
OTU 16 (Pusillimonas) and OTU 20 (Leucobacter) were found in cellars C2 and C1.Corynebacterium casei and C. variabile have been shown to be dominant on Danish surface-ripened cheeses ( Gori et al., 2013). The presence of C. glutamicum
 on Fontina cheese rinds has been confirmed and the species has been 
suggested to be among the most important ripening bacteria, increasing 
in abundance towards the end of ripening ( Dolci et al., 2009 and Dolci et al., 2013). Brine, personnel, and equipment have been suggested as possible sources for Corynebacterium ( Brennan et al., 2002).
